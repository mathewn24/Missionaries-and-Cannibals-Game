# Missionaries-and-Cannibals-Game
This programs attempts to recreate the missionaries and cannibals problem using console output.
The problem can be described as such:

Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one bank of a river. There is one boat available that can carry at most two people. They would use it to cross the river. If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either of the riverâ€™s banks, the missionaries will get eaten! The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. Under these constraints, how can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals across the river?

The program expands this problem by allowing the user to input more than three missionaries and cannibals, as well as modify the boat size. Of course, there are contraints:
1. The number of cannibals can be at most the number of missionaries.
2. The boat cannot have a capacity less than or equal to 1.
3. If B = 2, cannibals must be less than 3.
4. if B = 4, cannibals must be less than 5.
